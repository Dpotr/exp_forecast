# Expense Forecast Dashboard

This project is an interactive web dashboard for forecasting categorized expenses, tracking accuracy KPIs, and ensuring reliable forecasts with backtesting and self-correction. It is built with Python, Streamlit, Prophet, and Plotly.

## Features
- **Expense Forecasting**: Forecasts daily expenses for the next 7 days by category, incorporating seasonality and country effects.
- **Backtesting & KPI Tracking**: Performs rolling backtests and calculates MAE, RMSE, and MAPE to ensure forecast quality before publishing.
- **Self-Correction**: Automatically updates and retrains models as new data arrives, ensuring adaptive and accurate predictions.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Stacked bar charts, forecast plots with confidence intervals, and KPI tables.
- **Country Regimes**: Highlights periods spent in Vietnam, Kazakhstan, and Montenegro, and uses these as features in the model.

## Usage
1. Place your historical expenses in `expenses.xlsx` (columns: `date`, `category`, `amount`).
2. Run the dashboard locally: `streamlit run app.py`
3. Or, use the live online dashboard (if deployed via [streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io)):
   - The dashboard will automatically update online after each push to the GitHub repository.
   - Simply update your code, commit, and push to GitHub. The online dashboard will reflect the latest changes after a short delay.
4. Explore raw data, monthly summaries, forecasts, and backtest KPIs in the browser.

## How forecasting works (for dummies)

### 1. Data Preparation
- Expenses are grouped by category and day.
- Only the last 30 days are used for forecasting to adapt to your current lifestyle.
- Outliers (top 1% of daily expenses) are removed to avoid skewed predictions.

### 2. Forecasting Model
- For each category, a time series model (Prophet) is trained on the last 30 days.
- The model uses a log-transform to stabilize variance:
  - **Formula:** `log_amount = log(1 + amount)`
- The model forecasts the next 7 days in log scale, then results are transformed back:
  - **Formula:** `forecast = exp(log_amount_forecast) - 1`
- Forecasts are never negative (clamped to zero).

### 3. Moving Average Baseline
- For comparison, a simple 7-day moving average of daily total expenses is shown.
- If the modelâ€™s forecast is much higher than this average, a warning is displayed.

### 4. Output Files
- Forecast results are saved to `forecast_results.xlsx` after each run.

### 5. Example
Suppose your last 30 days of daily expenses are:

| Date       | Amount |
|------------|--------|
| 2025-03-21 | 120    |
| 2025-03-22 | 80     |
| ...        | ...    |
| 2025-04-19 | 150    |
| 2025-04-20 | 90     |

The model will:
- Remove any days above the 99th percentile (outliers)
- Fit a model to the log of these amounts
- Forecast the next 7 days
- Transform the forecast back to normal scale and show it in the dashboard and Excel export

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies

## Model Details
- Uses Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting, with daily and yearly seasonality.
- Country is used as a categorical regressor.
- Forecasts are validated with rolling backtests, and confidence intervals are shown for each prediction.
