## Progress Tracking

### Completed Items
- [x] Initial performance assessment (2025-07-25)
- [x] Roadmap creation
- [x] **Phase 1 Complete** (2025-07-25): Enhanced outlier handling, weighted ensemble, rolling features

#### Phase 1 Implementation Details:
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced outlier handling**: Added percentile-based capping (95th/5th percentiles)
- ‚úÖ **Weighted ensemble method**: Dynamic weighting based on recent MAE performance
- ‚úÖ **Rolling features**: 7/14/30-day averages, trends, volatility measures
- ‚úÖ **Integration**: All features integrated into forecasting pipeline

#### Phase 1B Critical Fixes (2025-07-25):
- üîß **Fixed ensemble bugs**: Removed eval() function calls, improved error handling
- üîß **Simplified ensemble**: Changed to robust mean-median combination with volatility-based weighting
- üîß **Integrated outlier capping**: Now applied to ALL methods in main forecasting pipeline
- üîß **Enhanced reliability**: Added fallback mechanisms and better exception handling

### Phase 1B Results Analysis (CRITICAL):
- ‚ùå **NO IMPROVEMENT**: MAPE remains 219.3% (identical to baseline)
- ‚ùå **Core metrics unchanged**: MAE, WAPE, directional accuracy all same
- ‚ùå **Forecast patterns identical**: Still flat orange vs spiky blue actuals  
- ‚úÖ **System working correctly**: Backtesting avoided poor methods appropriately

### Root Cause Discovery:
**The fundamental problem is NOT statistical smoothing - it's EVENT PREDICTION**
- Expenses are EVENT-DRIVEN (rent due dates, school payments, car repairs)
- Current methods predict AVERAGES, missing TIMING of large expenses
- Need to predict WHEN events occur, not just smooth historical data

### Revised Strategy - Phase 2 Focus:
**Priority 1: EVENT-BASED FORECASTING**
- Calendar-aware predictions (monthly rent, quarterly school fees)
- Seasonal pattern detection for recurring large expenses  
- Historical event timing analysis

**Priority 2: SPIKE DETECTION & PREDICTION**
- Better periodic spike method implementation
- Multi-period seasonality (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- External calendar integration (school terms, payment schedules)

### In Progress
- [ ] **Phase 2 Pivot**: Event-based forecasting approach (URGENT)

### Blocked Items
- None currently

## Next Review Date
**Next Assessment: 2025-08-08** (2 weeks from roadmap creation)
